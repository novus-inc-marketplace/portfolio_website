You are my senior full-stack developer/designer.

In my novusinc directory sits my portfolio website project described below. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Animate.css, WOW.js and other included libraries, edit and upgrade this project to meet the following specifications:

Design & Aesthetics

Give every section (Home, About, Service, Project, Contact) a modern, premium look with 3D animations, parallax effects, smooth transitions, and subtle hover micro-interactions.

Maintain fast loading by using lazy loading, compressed assets, and optimized animations.

Apply a refined color scheme and typography consistent with our slogan “Ideas Into Action” — bold, clean, and innovative.

Brand Message

Create a short, emotionally engaging description for the hero section using the slogan “Ideas Into Action.”

Explain in one paragraph why we are good at what we do, how we do it, and what we sell (services), in a tone that adds value and sparks emotion.

Integrate this copy into the Home and About sections.

Contact Features

On every page, add a WhatsApp button that opens chat at https://wa.me/254798808105.

Ensure the existing contact form in contact.html sends emails to novusincmarketplace@gmail.com
 using a backend script or third-party service (provide code).

Add spam protection (honeypot or Google reCAPTCHA).

Newsletter Subscription

Add a simple subscription form (name + email) in the footer or a dedicated section.

Store submissions securely (use local storage, SQLite via Node, or integrate Mailchimp/Sendinblue).

Show success and error states.

Technical

Provide exact changes to each file (index.html, about.html, service.html, project.html, contact.html, css/style.css, js/main.js) to implement the above.

Show sample code snippets for animations (using WOW.js or GSAP) and for handling contact/newsletter submissions.

Make everything responsive (Bootstrap grid) and accessible (alt text, ARIA labels).

Deliverables

Updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Instructions on how to host the contact form and newsletter backend on GitHub Pages or an alternative lightweight backend.

Recommendations for maintaining performance and security.
